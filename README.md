# Stack-Overflow-Developer-Survey-Analysis
This project implements CRISP-DM methodology for data analysis
## Installation
For running this project, the most important library is Python 3 version of Anaconda Distribution. It installs all necessary packages for analysis and building models.
## Introducing the datasets
The data used in this project is from Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2017.
## File Description
All the python notebooks in this project carry out the processes such as data exploration, handling missing data through imputation, encoding categorical variables, overcoming overfitting.
The csv files are survey schema and survey results.
## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:
1. How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
2. What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
3. How bias played a role in the suggestions of developers for how to break into the field?
4. What factors contribute to job and career satisfaction?
## Results
The main findings of the code can be found in the respective notebooks.
